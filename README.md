# NodeAlgorithms
My attempt at practicing data structures in Node.js.  This is simply for practice and not much else.

##Installation

Make sure you run node package manager before playing around with the code.

    npm install

Reasoning for this is to help with debugging the Red-Black Trees (color coding nodes is fun!)

##Background

Following data structures/algorithms I have so far...

* Red-Black Tree
* Merge Sort

All of the following algorithms can be simply imported.  However, if you would like to see demonstrations of them, please simply run the file in the command line.  They will both (respectivly) run example code in the main section of the code.

Example: 

    node RedBlackTree.js
    node MergeSort.js
